                <h3>Mental Health Stigma Is...</h3>
                <p>
                    Having an unfair attitude or belief about someone with mental health challenges. 
                    Stigma can make people with mental illnesses feel ashamed or excluded. 
                    Stigma usually comes from not understanding mental illnesses.
                </p>
                <h3>Why Should We Fight for Mental Health Stigma?</h3>
                <p>
                    Stigma can lead to feelings of shame and self-consciousness. 
                    It can negatively impact help-seeking as well as early detection and prevention. 
                    Standing up to mental health stigma is an important way to support your own mental health 
                    and give a voice to those who are suffering in silence.
